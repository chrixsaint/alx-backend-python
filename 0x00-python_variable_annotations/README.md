## Concepts

In this project, participants are expected to explore the following concept:

- Advanced Python

## Resources

Read or watch:

- [Python 3 typing documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html)
- [MyPy cheat sheet](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cheat_sheet.html)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, I should be able to explain the following without Google's assistance:

- Type annotations in Python 3
- Using type annotations to specify function signatures and variable types
- Duck typing
- Validating code with mypy

## Requirements

**General:**
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using Python 3 (version 3.7)
- Files end with a new line
- The first line of all files is `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
- A mandatory README.md file at the root of the project folder
- Code follows pycodestyle style (version 2.5.)
- All files must be executable
- The length of files will be tested using `wc`
- All modules, classes, and functions have documentation
- Documentation is a real sentence explaining the purpose of the module, class, or method
